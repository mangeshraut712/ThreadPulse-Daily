## ✨ What is ThreadPulse Daily?

ThreadPulse Daily is a **Wordle-style daily puzzle game** where players guess Reddit-themed words using progressive hints. Each day brings a new puzzle drawn from Reddit culture, memes, community inside jokes, and platform mechanics.

**Play → Guess → Share → Community Clues → Repeat.**

### 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the daily puzzle** — A new puzzle appears every day at midnight UTC, seeded by date so every player gets the same challenge
2. **Read the first hint** — The first hint is always free and gives you a starting point
3. **Make your guess** — Type your answer and submit (you have 6 attempts)
4. **Unlock more hints** — Stuck? Tap locked hints to reveal them (each hint costs 15 points)
5. **Check community clues** — Read clues submitted by other players, or contribute your own
6. **Share your result** — Share your Wordle-style emoji grid on Reddit, X, or copy to clipboard

### 🎯 Scoring

| Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| Base score | 100 points |
| Hint penalty | −15 per hint (after the first) |
| Time penalty | −1 per 6 seconds (max −35) |
| Streak bonus | +1 per 2 streak days (max +25) |
| Minimum score | 5 points |

**Range:** 5 – 125 points per puzzle.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Production build
npm run build

# Build for Devvit deployment
npm run build:devvit

# Run all QA checks
npm run qa
```

## 🏗 Architecture Decisions

1. **No external CSS framework** — Custom design tokens for maximum control and performance
2. **Pure CSS animations** — Zero JS animation overhead, GameMaker-compatible
3. **LocalStorage persistence** — Streaks and game state survive page refresh
4. **Date-seeded RNG** — Deterministic puzzle selection via FNV-1a + Mulberry32
5. **Code splitting** — Vite auto-splits vendor, AI, animation, and UI chunks
6. **Type-safe throughout** — Strict TypeScript with no `any` in game logic
7. **Devvit message bridge** — Bidirectional communication between webview and Reddit host
8. **Progressive enhancement** — Core functionality works without AI or WASM

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm run test           # Self-test suite (39 checks)
npm run simulate       # Game simulation (5 scenarios)
npm run balance        # Game balance verification
npm run check:submission  # Submission package check
npm run verify:final   # Final verification (56 checks)
npm run qa             # Run all of the above
```
